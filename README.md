# Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
This project performs real-time human face detection using Python and OpenCV. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to recognize faces through your deviceâ€™s webcam and display them with bounding boxes on-screen.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
Also, download the Haar Cascade XML file:

Download haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

Save it in the same directory as your Python file.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone this repository or copy the project files to your local machine.

Make sure the Haar Cascade file and Python script are in the same folder.

Run the following command:

bash
python face_detection.py
The webcam will activate and begin scanning for faces.

Press the Q key to exit the program.
